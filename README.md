# ASP.NET-dnd
A personal project for a D&amp;D web application using ASP.NET Core 2.0 and SQL Server


## Helpful tutorials used along the way:

* [Dropdowns in .Net](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/binding-dropdown-list-with-database-in-asp-net-core-mvc/) - Used for the roll dropdowns
* [Large image on index page with transparent navbar](https://www.bootply.com/uldEaDBZOj#) - Make sure you _Layout.cshtml is in a "container-fluid" class and not just a "container" class or it will not reach to the edges of the webpage!
* [Cards for the character page](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp)
